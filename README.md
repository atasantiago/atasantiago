# bland-altman-demo
For the April 27, 2017 session of the Biostatistics Journal Club at Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute |
This project is intended to supplement discussions on Bland-Altman plots to assess measurement agreement between two methods or raters

# Code Description and Data 
The R script file contains sample code to generate a customized Bland-Altman plot using statistics calculated through the BlandAltmanLeh library (specifically for confidence limits) and base functions in R.  A toy example using scores from the 1994 Miss Universe competition is intended to demonstrate how to use Bland-Altman plots to accommodate subsets of a main data frame. csv and xlsx files have been uploaded for practice. Data from two judges were taken from a blogpost at www.criticalbeauty.com/2012/03/miss-universe-1994.html
